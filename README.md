# My docs

These are resources that I have found useful but I'm great at forgetting where I found them. So I'm putting them here.

## Tools

- [curl](https://curl.se/) - creating and testing HTTP requests
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) - processing JSON data
- [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) - generate `.gitignore` files

## Standards

- [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - no one knows what to write in a commit message
- [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) - common sence versioning
- [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) - good to have a changelog
